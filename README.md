_Figure 1_ The Canadian Marine Conservation Network, stratified by bioregion (top row) and by ocean region and conservation measure (bottom row). The top row illustrates the distribution of conservation areas within each bioregion, while the bottom row presents conservation measures organized by ocean region and management type. Polygons obtained from the Canadian Protected and Conserved Areas Database in spring 2025.

_Figure 2_ Percent coverage of conservation measures across different management types, stratified by bioregion and grouped by ocean region. The conservation ‘gap’ represented as the area require to achieve the GBF 30% target in each bioregion. Totals derived from the [Canadian Protected and Conserved Areas Database](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/national-wildlife-areas/protected-conserved-areas-database.html) Spring 2025.

_Figure 3_ Projected changes in sea surface temperature in MPAs in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Scotian Shelf Bioregions. Bars denote mean difference for 20 year periods relative to an average baseline value calculated using the GLORYS12 1993-2014 average. Standard deviation calculated using average of 22 CMIP6 models (McKee et al. 2025). Bars presented in groups for each time period and MPA with RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios denoted by top and bottom bars, respectively.

Also depicted MPAs in adjacent bioregions.
