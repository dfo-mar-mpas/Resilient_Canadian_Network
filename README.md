# Managing for long-term resilience in the Canadian Marine Conservation Network

***Abstract***

Biodiversity loss and climate change are closely linked threats to marine ecosystems, and marine conservation areas (MCAs) are widely promoted as key tools to address both. Canada has established a substantial network of MCAs, now covering over 15% of its marine estate, with a target of 30% by 2030 under the Global Biodiversity Framework. At the halfway point toward this commitment, rapid climate-driven ecological change raises questions about the long-term efficacy of static conservation strategies. This paper focuses on two challenges: (1) ensuring conservation objectives remain robust as ecosystems shift, and (2) improving adaptive management at both site and network scales to maintain ecological coherence and biodiversity. We synthesize Canada’s marine-conservation work by reviewing progress on MPA planning and management, climate-focused studies, the objectives set for protected areas, and the integration of Indigenous perspectives and knowledge. We assess how well objectives anticipate ongoing shifts and climate-change impacts, finding that about 30% of protected areas have objectives vulnerable to climate change. Addressing these challenges offers an opportunity to advance climate-smart planning and strengthen adaptive management across Canada’s growing marine-conservation network, helping to build a more resilient and adaptive system, better aligning with global conservation goals.

Bars denote mean difference for 20 year periods relative to an average baseline value calculated using the GLORYS12 1993-2014 average. Standard deviation calculated using average of 22 CMIP6 models [(McKee et al. 2025)](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2025/mpo-dfo/Fs97-18-406-eng.pdf). Bars presented in groups for each time period and MPA with RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios denoted by top and bottom bars, respectively.
